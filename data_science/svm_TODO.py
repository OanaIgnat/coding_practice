'''
How is SVMâ€™s hyperplane different from linear classifiers?

Motivation: Maximize margin: we want to find the classifier whose decision boundary is furthest away from any data point.
We can express the separating hyper-plane in terms of the data points that are closest to the boundary.
And these points are called support vectors.
