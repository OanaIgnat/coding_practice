## Sorting: 
- counting sort (element frequencies)
- merge sort (mid: split in halves, then merge)
- quick sort (pivot: sort what is less & greater than pivot then add together)
- bubble sort (while not sorted, sort again)

## Searching:
- sequential search 
- binary search (half interval / logarithmic) - on sorted lists

## Data Structures:
### Stack - for DFS
 - LIFO: The only way to add one and/or remove is from the top.
 - reverse a string
 - check for balanced parantheses
 - DFS
### Queue - for BFS
 - FIFO: Like a line at a store 
 - BFS
### Arrays
 - fixed size
 - insert & delete expensive
### Linked Lists (LL)
 - dynamic size
 - insert & delete easy
 - random access not allowed
 - singly, doubly, circular LL
### Binary Search Tree
 - left subtree has smaller keys, right subtree has larger
